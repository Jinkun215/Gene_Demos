In this project, I created a digital measuring stick. It will measure the moved distance of a potentiometer.

This project will demonstrate the use of ADC, NVIC SysTick ISR, UART using the TM4C123 development board.
It will show my general understanding of sampling real world data into digital data.

Please take a look at the video demo or the source code for more information.
