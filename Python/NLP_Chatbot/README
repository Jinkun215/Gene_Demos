This Python codes are from my senior project at the California State Polytechnic University, Pomona.
Our team decided to use a NLP (Natural Language Processing) based chatbot.
By importing NLTK, Pytorch, and numpy, we made a Feed Forward based neural network model.

The purpose of the chatbot is to take in customer questions for a kickboxing gym I work at, and answer the questions.
Please see the demo file for a link to the video.
