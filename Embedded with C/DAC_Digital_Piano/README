In this project, I created a digital piano that will play the notes of a scale from C to the next C, one octave above (C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C)

This project demonstrates the use of Binary-Weighted DAC, NVIC SysTick ISR using the TM4C123 development board.
It shows my general understanding of converting electrical energy to sound energy.
