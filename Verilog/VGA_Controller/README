Gene Drumheller

In this project, I made a 640 x 480 resolution VGA controller using a Nexsy4DDR FPGA board, written in Verilog. 
The project was done using the Vivado 2021.2 software.
There are 8 different VGA output that is controled using UART communication protocol.  The data that control the output is sent from my computer to the FPGA.


Please watch the Demo or view the code for more details.
