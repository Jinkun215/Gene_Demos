In this Project, our team explains the basic description and usage of the XTEA Encryption, developed by David Wheeler and Roger Needham in 1997, 
and the results of gauging the power usage and efficiency of the algorithms.  
The experiment was conducted on Arduino Uno using the C language and  Raspberry Pi 3 B+ using the Python 2 language.  
We concluded the code under Arduino to run with less than half the power usage than the Raspberry Pi.
