In this project, I have simulated a 2-way traffic light signals and a walking signal using the TM4C123 Texas Launch Pad, Switches, and LED's.
As for the code itself, I've use a moore's finite state machine to transition states without using conditional branching.

Please see the video demo and the source code for more details
