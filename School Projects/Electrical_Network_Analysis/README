Please see each file for the lab reports I made for California State Polytechnic University, Pomona Electrical and Computer Engineering cirriculum 209 Network Analysis II.
Downloading each doc may be required.

The labs demonstrate the use of oscillators, RLC circuits, op-amps, differential equations, calculating steady state responses, gain, phase, etc.
