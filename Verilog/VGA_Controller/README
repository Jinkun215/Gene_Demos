Gene Drumheller

In this project, I demonstrate a 640 x 480 resolution VGA controller using a Nexsy4DDR FPGA board
Using the UART communication protocol, I send a value from a computer which allows me to output 8 different VGA pattern on my screen
I make sure I am receiving the correct input by displaying the data on the boards seven segment display and the UART transmitter

See Demo and Project code for more details
